### What is it
A single table sqlite app built with a MVC (Model View Controller) Architecture. Contact is the Model, DatabaseHander is Controller, and the
View is still undecided. I'm thinking it will be a one page app built with flask or desktop app built with tkinter. This is a fun app
because its converted Java code. I built a SQLite project with Android and then I thought to myself that data bases are just like data 
structures I had been learning about. Sqlites implements a queue and content values which are similar to hash maps or dictionaries just more
efficient and made for data bases.

### Dependencies
sqlite3 -- builtin

### Shoutout
@Paulo Dichone for the awesome Android project I'm learning to create which has improved my programming skills as a whole. Learning to
create packages and abstract away layers of my code to keep my main class as maintainable as possible was a much needed bump. Once this is 
Complete I will have built my first Python package after a year of programming and its thanks to you.
